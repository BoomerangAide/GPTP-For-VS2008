Update 3:

-Minor fixes and optimizations
-Moving functions from helpers to CUnit functions:
	order_computerCL
	getUnitMovableState
	00474D60 __order (was imitated by Infestation instead of being called)
	removeAcidSpores (not seen much as helper though)
	issueQueuedOrderTarget
-scbwdata.h improvements
-Moving my orders based hooks in a separate subfolder
-Fix for drawEllipse graphics function and adding drawDottedEllipse function
-Fix for CUnit::getColor (so it return the correct value...probably all the time)
-Fix for units cloaking hook (could cause crashes if used from another hook, or lead to instability)
-Changes on buttonsets hook (maybe easier to debug this way)
-Add StringEmpty variable in scbwdata.h (in case Starcraft would check if a string is empty by comparing
	the pointer to a char* to that value (could happen since it's the official empty string address))
** Unit Merge (from archons merge) hook **
** Larva and Creep Spawn (concentrating more on larvas) hook **
** Lift and Land hook **
** Attack orders hooks **
** Stop/Hold Position orders hooks **
** Recall Spell hooks **
** Enter Nydus hooks **
** Weapon/Spell Hit hooks ** (NOTE: Old Consume hook is removed from project since it's included in this)
** Cast Order hook **

*Planned:
    -more hooks for orders
    -(if possible) identification on missing DatLoad entries
    -(in this update or later) attempts on CMDACT functions (to improve orders useability)
    -(if possible) research on cheat codes (are there unknown/incomplete ones?Is it possible to add some?)
    -others???
    -make commonly used helper into functions centralized somewhere else (api,CUnit,scbwdata or whatever fit)

-------------------------


Update 2:

Improving DatLoad for researchers (though some features will be useful for ordinary modders)
Adding more infos on BinDlg in structures.h (since I met this in assembly)
Add a constant for the size of selection arrays
Fixing an error in SoundId.h
Fix a bug in psi_field_util.cpp
Re-adding helpers in tech_target_check.cpp (it's better to not have hooks rely too much on others, and it will remains compatible anyways.
Infestation hook: infesting unit side
Adding something in SoundId.h: namespace DeathSoundId { const u16 deathSoundIdList[UnitId::None+1][2]; }
	This is meant to be used by something like 
	scbw::playSound(
		scbw::randBetween(
			DeathSoundId::deathSoundIdList[unit->id][0],
			DeathSoundId::deathSoundIdList[unit->id][1]
		);
	);
	to play a random death sound, according to the ones used in Iscript.bin.
Adding IconId enum (because it's used in buttonset hook)
**Infestation hook: Completed**
**Adding buttonsets hook and features related to it.**
**Siege Transform hook: siege mode and tank mode orders**
**Selection hook added**

-------------------------

Update "1st-big-update" :

Fix Valkyrie Text
Add new image-related and colors-related functions
Add new enum and flags, and use them instead of raw values
Remove some comments in structures thanks to enum and flags
Update some values/comments based on BWAPI data
Remove "using" in middle of files (unsafe use for this keyword)
Add new enumeration files (like SpriteId.h or SoundId.h)
Fixed function getMaxHpInGame (wasn't always doing what it was supposed to do)
Add a few lines in existing enums (mainly "None" entries). 
Adding the combined UnitMovement flag for hover units and using it
Updated the .vcproj file (though I'm not sure if this is enough to allow a fully downloaded source to work immediately)
Added a different message than the "incorrect starcraft version" message for StarEdit.
**Added the new hook files infestation.h, infestation.cpp and infestation_inject.cpp**
